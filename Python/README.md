# (In)secure Programming Python
This directory contains Python 2.x (targeting 2.7 line) source code examples demonstrating insecure coding practices, exploiting Python characteristics. 

Do not run this code in production environment!

## How to run code snippets
We suggest to run those code snippets (if you really need to do so) in the following way:

python -OOBRstt script_name.py 

## Best Practices for security review
In the Python-source-code-review-Best-practices.pdf file you can find our best practices for reviewing Python code for security related defects.
