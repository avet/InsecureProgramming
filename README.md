# (In)secure Programming library

As a part of AVET INS Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) practice weâ€™ve decided to publish insecure code examples. Those source code snippets can be used both to teach developers how no to write code and for testing purposes of your static source code analysis toolkit.

Every directory contains insecure code snippets for particular technology.
If you have any questions regarding application security and our library please do not hesitate to contact as at: www.avet.com.pl
